- 👋 Hi, I’m @0x544a204f4c65617279
- 👀 I’m interested in software development as it pertains to offensive security. 
- I hope to become proficient in various programming languages like Python, Go, C, Rust and Javascript with the goal of not onlu being able to build software but script out helpers 
  to automate tasks and carry on concurrent activity to make me even more efficient!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects to speed up proficiency and build even larger projects in areas that lack useful tooling/browser extensions.
- 📫 I can be most effectively reached at my best email: redtmsec@gmail.com
